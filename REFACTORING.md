# Refactoring Documentation

## Component Structure Refactoring (2024)

### Summary

The codebase had accumulated duplicate components in two locations:
- `/src/components` - The main components directory
- `/src/app/components` - A duplicate components directory inside the app folder

This duplication created confusion around which component versions should be used and made maintenance more difficult. The refactoring consolidated all components into the `/src/components` directory.

### Changes Made

1. **Components Consolidation**
   - Removed duplicate components in `/src/app/components` directory
   - Ensured all components are maintained in a single `/src/components` location
   - Verified imports were already using the correct paths with `@/components/...` format
   - Created a backup of the removed components in `/backup-components` directory (for reference)

2. **Standardized Import Patterns**
   - Confirmed all imports are using the `@/` alias format (e.g., `import Component from '@/components/Component'`)
   - No relative imports between components directory and app directory

3. **Verification**
   - Confirmed build process works correctly after changes
   - Verified application functions correctly in development mode
   - Ensured all pages load properly

### Future Improvements

Future refactoring work could include:

1. **Component Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc-style comments to key components
   - Create a component catalog for easier reference

2. **Further Code Splitting**
   - Review large components and split them into smaller, more focused components
   - Especially for components exceeding 350 lines

3. **Import Optimization**
   - Consider barrel files (index.ts exports) to simplify imports
   - Optimize bundle size with more specific imports

### Backup Reference

A backup of the removed duplicate components can be found in the `/backup-components` directory at the project root. This is for reference only and should not be used in the application.
